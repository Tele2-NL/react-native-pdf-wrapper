## Why?

This library was created to solve a problem of [react-native-pdf] which has a lot of issues with showing PDFs in iOS. Apple released [PDFKit] that solved all those problems but only for `iOS >= 11`, this library basically mimics all the file handling of `react-native-pdf` for iOS 10 and then show it on `react-native`'s `<WebView />`, any version `>= 11` will fallback to `react-native-pdf`.

## Installation

This library requires [react-native-pdf] (to show PDF for iOS >= 11 and Android) and [rn-fetch-blob] to handle file system access.

```bash
yarn add @tele2/react-native-pdf-wrapper react-native-pdf rn-fetch-blob
```

You will need to link native code as well:

```bash
react-native link @tele2/react-native-pdf-wrapper # required only for iOS
react-native link react-native-pdf
react-native link rn-fetch-blob
```

If you have any doubts on how to install [react-native-pdf][react-native-pdf-installation] or [rn-fetch-blob][rn-fetch-blob-installation] please refer to the respective repositories.

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PdfWrapper from '@tele2/react-native-pdf-wrapper';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    /**
    * `source` can also be:
    * - source={require('./file.pdf')}
    * - source={{ uri: 'base64-string' }}
    */
    return (
      <PdfWrapper
        source={{
          uri: 'https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/pages/506699/amsterdam_and_europe_historical_ties_eu2016_edition.pdf',
        }}
      />
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```
